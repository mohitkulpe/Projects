Pre Requisite:
- python 3.x
- Install Matplotlib https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html , you can do this with `conda install matplotlib`.
- Install Sklearn http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html , you can do this with `conda install scikit-learn`.
- Install Scipy https://www.scipy.org/install.html , you can do this with `conda install -c anaconda scipy`.
- Download 'bw_digit_dataset.csv' which is provided with this project because this dataset is standardized data on which the Model will train and also test image will be standardized to this format only.


OK, now you're ready to predict digits!


Provide image with name 'test.png' but make sure its dimensions has to be 28x28 pixels.

System will predict the provided number with accuracy of 92.63%.
