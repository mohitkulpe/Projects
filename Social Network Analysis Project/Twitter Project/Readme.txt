Collecting Political Social Network Data

In this Project, I've taken list of Twitter accounts of 4 U.S. presedential candidates from the previous election (2016). The list of 4 Candidates is in candidates.txt

The goal is to use the Twitter API to construct a social network of these accounts. Then use the networkx library to plot these links, as well as print some statistics of the resulting graph.

Steps:

    Create an account on twitter.com.
    Generate authentication tokens by following the instructions here.
    Add your tokens to the key/token variables below. (API Key == Consumer Key)
    Be sure you've installed the Python modules networkx and TwitterAPI.

Assuming you've already installed pip, you can do this with pip install networkx TwitterAPI.

OK, now you're ready to start collecting some data!
