Movie Ratings Prediction using Genre as a Content

Here I've implemented a content-based recommendation algorithm.
It will use the list of genres for a movie as the content.
Then Cosine similarity will be used to find nearest items.

I have tested this system on Training set of 99903 records & testing set of 101 records.

Error Rate of System is 0.900795.
