Sentiment Analysis using Lexicon Technique

In this project, I built a text classifier to determine whether a movie review is expressing positive or negative sentiment. The data come from
the website IMDB.com.

Steps:
1. Preprocess the data in different ways (creating different features).
2. Compare the cross-validation accuracy of each approach.
3. Compute accuracy on a test set and do analysis of the errors.
